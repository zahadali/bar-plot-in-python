# Description
In this project, we are taking the data of lightning strikes in 2018. This data is structured day-wise.
The dates are stored in string format. We will change this string format to datetime format.
Then we will apply simple date manipulation to summarize the count of lightning strikes per month.
Finally, with the help of bar chart visualization, we will identify the month with the highest number of lightning strikes.
